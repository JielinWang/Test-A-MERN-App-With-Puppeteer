# Test-A-MERN-App-With-Puppeteer

## The app is split into two folders:
- src/App.js contains the entire screen content along with the buttons.
- src/App.css contains the styles for the application.
- server.js contains the code for starting the express server and defining the two express routes for creating and deleting users.
- src/database.js contains the code for initializing the MongoDB database.
- src/puppeteer.js contains the code I have modified to test while clicking the “Create User” button.
- Client, which contains the React portion of the application
- Server, which contains the back end portion
